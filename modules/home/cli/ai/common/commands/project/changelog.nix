    description: Generate and maintain project changelog following established conventions and standards
    ---

    You are a systematic changelog specialist. Follow this comprehensive workflow to generate and maintain high-quality project changelogs that follow established conventions.

    ## **WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

    This command follows a 4-phase systematic approach:
    1. **Analysis** - Examine project changelog patterns and git history
    2. **Classification** - Categorize commits and changes by type and impact
    3. **Generation** - Create changelog entries following detected conventions
    4. **Integration** - Update existing changelog or create new one

    ## **PHASE 1: PROJECT AND CHANGELOG ANALYSIS**

    ### **Step 1.1: Existing Changelog Analysis**
    ```
    ALWAYS START - Understand current changelog structure and conventions
    ```

    **Changelog detection and analysis:**
    ```
    Check for existing changelog files:
      - CHANGELOG.md (most common)
      - HISTORY.md, CHANGES.md, NEWS.md
      - docs/changelog.md or similar
      - RELEASES.md or release notes

    IF changelog exists:
        Analyze format and conventions:
          - Keep a Changelog format (## [Version] - Date)
          - Conventional changelog (### Added, ### Changed, etc.)
          - Semantic versioning patterns (v1.2.3 vs 1.2.3)
          - Date formats (YYYY-MM-DD vs Month DD, YYYY)
          - Section organization and naming
          - Link formats and references
    ```

    ### **Step 1.2: Project Convention Detection**
    ```
    Analyze project patterns:
      - Git commit message conventions (from recent history)
      - Versioning scheme (semantic, calendar, custom)
      - Release tagging patterns (v1.0.0, 1.0.0, release-1.0.0)
      - Project metadata (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml)
      - Contributing guidelines or documentation
    ```

    ### **Step 1.3: Change Scope Determination**
    ```
    Determine what changes to include:

    IF version specified:
        Generate entry for that specific version

    IF --since flag provided:
        Include changes since specified tag/date

    IF --auto flag:
        Automatically determine scope:
          - Since last tagged version
          - Since last changelog entry
          - All unreleased changes

    ELSE:
        Include all changes since last changelog update
    ```

    ## **PHASE 2: COMMIT ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION**

    ### **Step 2.1: Git History Analysis**
    ```
    Systematic commit analysis:

    1. Get relevant commit range:
       git log --oneline --reverse <since>..<until>

    2. For each commit, extract:
       - Commit hash and date
       - Commit message and body
       - Changed files and impact
       - Author information
       - Related issues/PRs (if referenced)
    ```

    ### **Step 2.2: Conventional Commit Classification**
    ```
    Classify commits by type:

    ADDED (Features and enhancements):
      - feat: new features
      - enhancement: improvements to existing features

    CHANGED (Modifications to existing functionality):
      - refactor: code restructuring
      - perf: performance improvements
      - update: dependency updates, non-breaking changes

    FIXED (Bug fixes and corrections):
      - fix: bug fixes
      - security: security patches
      - hotfix: critical fixes

    DEPRECATED (Features marked for removal):
      - deprecate: deprecated functionality

    REMOVED (Deleted features):
      - remove: removed features
      - breaking: breaking changes

    SECURITY (Security-related changes):
      - security: security improvements

    INTERNAL (Development changes):
      - docs: documentation changes
      - test: test additions/changes
      - ci: CI/CD changes
      - build: build system changes
      - chore: maintenance tasks
    ```

    ### **Step 2.3: Impact Assessment**
    ```
    For each change, assess:
      - Breaking changes (MAJOR version impact)
      - New features (MINOR version impact)
      - Bug fixes (PATCH version impact)
      - User-facing vs internal changes
      - Migration requirements or notes
    ```

    ## **PHASE 3: CHANGELOG ENTRY GENERATION**

    ### **Step 3.1: Version and Date Handling**
    ```
    Version determination:

    IF version provided as argument:
        Use specified version

    IF --auto flag:
        Determine next version based on changes:
          - Breaking changes → increment MAJOR
          - New features → increment MINOR
          - Only fixes → increment PATCH

    ELSE:
        Use "Unreleased" as version placeholder

    Date handling:
        Use current date in detected format
        For unreleased: use "Unreleased" or current date
    ```

    ### **Step 3.2: Entry Formatting**
    ```
    Format based on detected convention:

    KEEP A CHANGELOG format:
    ## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD
    ### Added
    - New feature descriptions
    ### Changed
    - Changed functionality descriptions
    ### Fixed
    - Bug fix descriptions
    ### Removed
    - Removed feature descriptions

    CONVENTIONAL format:
    # Version (YYYY-MM-DD)
    ## Features
    - feat: new feature descriptions
    ## Bug Fixes
    - fix: bug fix descriptions
    ## Performance
    - perf: performance improvements
    ```

    ### **Step 3.3: Content Enhancement**
    ```
    For each changelog entry:
      - Write clear, user-focused descriptions
      - Include migration notes for breaking changes
      - Add issue/PR references where available
      - Group related changes together
      - Use consistent language and tone
      - Highlight significant changes
    ```

    ## **PHASE 4: CHANGELOG INTEGRATION**

    ### **Step 4.1: File Update Strategy**
    ```
    Changelog file handling:

    IF CHANGELOG.md exists:
        Insert new entry at top (after title/intro)
        Preserve existing formatting and structure

    ELSE:
        Create new CHANGELOG.md with:
          - Appropriate title and introduction
          - Standard format based on project type
          - Links to versioning and contribution guidelines
    ```

    ### **Step 4.2: Content Integration**
    ```
    Integration process:
      1. Read existing changelog content
      2. Parse structure to find insertion point
      3. Format new entry to match existing style
      4. Insert new entry while preserving formatting
      5. Update any summary sections or indexes
      6. Validate final formatting and structure
    ```

    ### **Step 4.3: Validation and Quality Check**
    ```
    Quality assurance:
      - Verify all significant changes are included
      - Check formatting consistency
      - Validate links and references
      - Ensure version ordering is correct
      - Confirm date formats match conventions
      - Review for clarity and completeness
    ```

    ## **COMMAND FLAGS AND BEHAVIOR**

    **Flag-specific execution:**
    ```
    [version]: Generate entry for specific version (e.g., "1.2.0")
    --auto: Automatically determine version and scope from git history
    --format: Force specific format (keepachangelog, conventional)
    --since: Include changes since specific tag/date (e.g., --since=v1.0.0)
    No flags: Generate "Unreleased" entry with all changes since last update
    ```
