          description: Analyze changes, stage them in atomic chunks, and commit with conventional messages
          ---

          Analyze all unstaged changes and group them into logical, atomic commits.
          For each chunk:
          1. Stage only the relevant files/changes for that logical unit
          2. Generate an appropriate conventional commit message
          3. Create the commit

          Consider these grouping strategies:
          - By feature/functionality (new features together)
          - By file type/area (config changes, docs, tests)
          - By scope (same module/component changes)
          - By change type (fixes, refactoring, etc.)

          Ensure each commit is atomic and follows conventional commit standards.
